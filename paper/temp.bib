abstract = {{Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with aberrant neuronal activity, which is believed to critically determine disease symptoms. How these activity alterations emerge, how stable they are over time, and whether cellular activity dynamics are affected by the amyloid plaque pathology remains incompletely understood. We here repeatedly recorded the activity from identified neurons in cortex of awake APPPS1 transgenic mice over four weeks during the early phase of plaque deposition using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We found that aberrant activity during this stage largely persisted over the observation time. Novel highly active neurons slowly emerged from former intermediately active neurons. Furthermore, activity fluctuations were independent of plaque proximity, but aberrant activity was more likely to persist close to plaques. These results support the notion that neuronal network pathology observed in models of cerebral amyloidosis is the consequence of persistent single cell aberrant neuronal activity, a finding of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance for AD. To advance our understanding of aberrant neuronal activity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) Korzhova et al. use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from cortical neurons of awake APPPS1 transgenic mice over four weeks, during the early phase of plaque deposition. They demonstrate that neuronal network pathology in models of cerebral amyloidosis is the consequence of persistent single cell aberrant neuronal activity, which could have diagnostic and therapeutic relevance for AD.}},

Using repeated in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that increases in spine size are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) dependent and thus are likely associated with synaptic scaling. Rather than occurring at all spines, the observed increases in spine size are spatially localized to a subset of dendritic branches and are correlated with the degree of recent local spine loss within that branch. Using simulations, we show that such a compartmentalized form of synaptic scaling has computational benefits over cell-wide scaling for information processing within the cell.}},

Transection of parallel fibers by two lesions placed at a 1 mm interval on the folial crest were used to produce degeneration of these afferents. Ultrastructural analysis of synapses on Purkinje cell spines revealed degeneration with vacating of postsynaptic sites within 6 h. Reactive synaptogenesis as takeover of Purkinje cell spines by formation of new synapses from remaining parallel fibers occurred even before degenerating parallel fibers had vacated postsynaptic sites. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of dual innervations by reactive parallel fibers within one day. Some vacated postsynaptic sites were lost as indicated by a reduction in the number of synapses and others may have been taken over by newly formed synapses on spines. In addition, new synapses formed between the shafts of Purkinje cell branchlets and parallel fibers. Sprouting of parallel fibers occurred as small extensions without tubules while Purkinje cell spines reacted by forming elongated and multiple heads which contacted different parallel fibers. After 5 days degenerating boutons were rarely found. Enlarged spine heads were each capped by a proportionally enlarged parallel fiber bouton and joined by an elongated synaptic junction to parallel fibers. Some parallel fiber boutons were greatly enlarged and capped numerous profiles of spines.This study shows that formation of new pre- and postsynaptic sites takes precedence over reoccupation of original contacts and that multiple synapses on individual spines are being eliminated to give rise to single contacts with boutons. This elimination resulted in enlargement of synaptic contact areas between Purkinje cell spines and parallel fibers by taking over postsynaptic sites from some vacated and eliminated boutons.}},

Recent work has revealed changes in neurite architecture associated with plaques and functional changes in cortical signaling in amyloid precursor protein (APP) expressing mouse models of AD. Here we developed a method using gene transfer techniques to introduce green fluorescent protein (GFP) into neurons, allowing the investigation of neuronal processes in the vicinity of plaques. Multiphoton imaging of GFP-labeled neurons in living Tg2576 APP mice revealed disrupted neurite trajectories and reductions in dendritic spine density compared with age-matched control mice. A profound deficit in spine density (∼50\%) extends ∼20 μm from plaque edges. Importantly, a robust decrement (∼25\%) also occurs on dendrites not associated with plaques, suggesting widespread loss of postsynaptic apparatus. Plaques and dendrites remained stable over the course of weeks of imaging. Postmortem analysis of axonal immunostaining and colocalization of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 95 protein staining around plaques indicate a parallel loss of presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. These results show considerable changes in dendrites and dendritic spines in APP transgenic mice, demonstrating a dramatic synaptotoxic effect of dense-cored plaques. Decreased spine density will likely contribute to altered neural system function and behavioral impairments observed in Tg2576 mice.}},

abstract = {{The synapse has consistently been considered a vulnerable and critical target within Alzheimer’s disease, and synapse loss is, to date, one of the main biological correlates of cognitive decline within Alzheimer’s disease. This occurs prior to neuronal loss with ample evidence that synaptic dysfunction precedes this, in support of the idea that synaptic failure is a crucial stage within disease pathogenesis. The two main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, abnormal aggregates of amyloid or tau proteins, have had demonstrable effects on synaptic physiology in animal and cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease. There is also growing evidence that these two proteins may have a synergistic effect on neurophysiological dysfunction. Here, we review some of the main findings of synaptic alterations in Alzheimer’s disease, and what we know from Alzheimer’s disease animal and cellular models. First, we briefly summarize some of the human evidence to suggest that synapses are altered, including how this relates to network activity. Subsequently, animal and cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease are considered, highlighting mouse models of amyloid and tau pathology and the role these proteins may play in synaptic dysfunction, either in isolation or examining how the two pathologies may interact in dysfunction. This specifically focuses on neurophysiological function and dysfunction observed within these animal models, typically measured using electrophysiology or calcium imaging. Following synaptic dysfunction and loss, it would be impossible to imagine that this would not alter oscillatory activity within the brain. Therefore, this review also discusses how this may underpin some of the aberrant oscillatory patterns seen in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease and human patients. Finally, an overview of some key directions and considerations in the field of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease is covered. This includes current therapeutics that are targeted specifically at synaptic dysfunction, but also methods that modulate activity to rescue aberrant oscillatory patterns. Other important future avenues of note in this field include the role of non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes and microglia, and mechanisms of dysfunction independent of amyloid and tau in Alzheimer’s disease. The synapse will certainly continue to be an important target within Alzheimer’s disease for the foreseeable future.}},

Because dendritic spines, the postsynaptic site of excitatory synapses, are easily visualized using light microscopy, we focus on a range of microscopy approaches to monitor synaptic loss and compensation. Here, we stress the importance of longitudinal dendritic spine imaging, as opposed to fixed-tissue imaging, to gain insights into the temporal dynamics of dendritic spine compensation.

However, at many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain, the distribution of numerous parameters is in fact strongly skewed with a heavy tail, suggesting that skewed (typically lognormal) distributions are fundamental to structural and functional brain organization.

In contrast, GluR2/GluR3 receptors replace existing synaptic receptors continuously; this occurs only at synapses that already have AMPA-Rs and requires interactions by GluR2 with NSF and group II PDZ domain proteins.

The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.}},

We find that local connectivity is comparable with mouse layer 2/3 connections in the anatomical homologue (temporal association area), but synaptic connections in human are 3-fold stronger and more reliable (0\% vs 25\% failure rates, respectively). We developed a theoretical approach to quantify properties of spinous synapses showing that synaptic conductance and voltage change in human dendritic spines are 3–4-folds larger compared with mouse, leading to significant NMDA receptor activation in human unitary connections. This model prediction was validated experimentally by showing that NMDA receptor activation increases the amplitude and prolongs decay of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials in human but not in mouse connections.

NMDAR transport packets are more mobile than AMPAR subunits, moving along microtubules at about 4 μm/min, and are recruited to sites of axodendritic contact within minutes.

Receptors are stabilized by a network that consists of scaffold proteins, adhesion proteins and the cytoskeleton, and changes in the receptor profile of the membrane are mediated by endocytosis, exocytosis and diffusion. Receptor diffusion has a role during the formation of new synapses, and during synaptic turnover and synaptic plasticity. There are five main categories of diffusion, ranging from 'free' to 'confined'. The subsynaptic scaffold network constitutes a barrier to receptor movement, resulting in confined diffusion. Techniques such as single particle tracking and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching have been used to follow receptor movements. Fast random movements are interspersed with periods of relative immobility, indicating the presence of transient submicrometre domains in the membrane that are separated by barriers. Within these domains, receptor diffusion is as fast as expected from theoretical calculations. Receptors can escape these 'corrals' by 'jumping the fence' or by passing through gaps when the membrane skeleton is transiently dissociated. Receptors can diffuse individually or as part of a cluster. Clusters are aggregations of receptors that are stabilized by their associations with scaffold components. Diffusion of cluster-associated receptors may be due to movement of the entire cluster or movement of the individual receptor within the cluster. Equilibrium between receptors entering and exiting subdomains (corrals) accounts for the apparent stability of the postsynaptic membrane. So, gross changes in receptor number during synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity can be considered to result from a change in the set-point of this equilibrium. The structure of the postsynaptic membrane is highly heterogeneous and dynamic. Receptors are stabilized by a network that consists of scaffold proteins, adhesion proteins and the cytoskeleton, and changes in the receptor profile of the membrane are mediated by endocytosis, exocytosis and diffusion. Receptor diffusion has a role during the formation of new synapses, and during synaptic turnover and synaptic plasticity. There are five main categories of diffusion, ranging from 'free' to 'confined'. The subsynaptic scaffold network constitutes a barrier to receptor movement, resulting in confined diffusion. Techniques such as single particle tracking and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching have been used to follow receptor movements. Fast random movements are interspersed with periods of relative immobility, indicating the presence of transient submicrometre domains in the membrane that are separated by barriers. Within these domains, receptor diffusion is as fast as expected from theoretical calculations. Receptors can escape these 'corrals' by 'jumping the fence' or by passing through gaps when the membrane skeleton is transiently dissociated. Receptors can diffuse individually or as part of a cluster. Clusters are aggregations of receptors that are stabilized by their associations with scaffold components. Diffusion of cluster-associated receptors may be due to movement of the entire cluster or movement of the individual receptor within the cluster. Equilibrium between receptors entering and exiting subdomains (corrals) accounts for the apparent stability of the postsynaptic membrane. So, gross changes in receptor number during synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity can be considered to result from a change in the set-point of this equilibrium. Neurotransmitter receptor movement into and out of synapses is one of the core mechanisms for rapidly changing the number of functional receptors during synaptic plasticity. Recent data have shown that rapid gain and loss of receptors from synaptic sites are accounted for by endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as by lateral diffusion of receptors in the plane of the membrane. These events are interdependent and are regulated by neuronal activity and interactions with scaffolding proteins. Here we focus on the physical laws that govern receptor diffusion and stabilization, and how this might reshape how we think about the specific regulation of receptor accumulation at synapses.}},

We further demonstrate that locally enhancing cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion or photo-stimulating a contacting channelrhodopsin-expressing axon stabilized the manipulated spine and eliminated its neighbors, an effect requiring cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion. Importantly, we show that differential cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion between neighboring spines biased spine fate in vivo.

Does local competition between neighboring synapses drive circuit remodeling during experience-dependent plasticity in the cerebral cortex? Here, we examined the role of activity-mediated competitive interactions in regulating dendritic spine structure and function on hippocampal CA1 neurons. We found that high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation at individual spines, which leads to input-specific synaptic potentiation, induces shrinkage and weakening of nearby unstimulated synapses. This heterosynaptic plasticity requires potentiation of multiple neighboring spines, suggesting that a local threshold of neural activity exists beyond which inactive synapses are punished. Notably, inhibition of calcineurin, IP3Rs, or group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) blocked heterosynaptic shrinkage without blocking structural potentiation, and inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocked structural potentiation without blocking heterosynaptic shrinkage. Our results support a model in which activity-induced shrinkage signal, and not competition for limited structural resources, drives heterosynaptic structural and functional depression during neural circuit refinement.}},

In part, this view is based on evidence that the efficacy of synapses can be enhanced or depressed depending on the timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity2,3,4,5. However, when such plastic synapses are incorporated into neural network models, stability problems may develop because the potentiation or depression of synapses increases the likelihood that they will be further strengthened or weakened6. Here we report biological evidence for a homeostatic mechanism that reconciles the apparently opposite requirements of plasticity and stability. We show that, in intercalated neurons of the amygdala, activity-dependent potentiation or depression of particular glutamatergic inputs leads to opposite changes in the strength of inputs ending at other dendritic sites. As a result, little change in total synaptic weight occurs, even though the relative strength of inputs is modified. Furthermore, hetero- but not homosynaptic alterations are blocked by intracellular dialysis of drugs that prevent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus, in intercalated neurons at least, inverse heterosynaptic plasticity tends to compensate for homosynaptic long-term potentiation and depression, thus stabilizing total synaptic weight.}},

However, new experimental findings demonstrate that HSP can operate locally, controlling each synapse individually. Seemingly, this finding implies that HSP can abolish any modification of synaptic strength (erase LTP/LTD).

In addition to the well known passive membrane time constant, τm = RmCm, observed in the decay of a uniform membrane potential, there exist many smaller time constants that govern rapid equalization of membrane potential over the length. These time constants are present also in the transient response to a current step applied across the membrane at one location, such as the neuron soma. Similar time constants are derived when a lumped soma is coupled to one or more cylinders representing one or more dendritic trees. Different time constants are derived when a voltage clamp is applied at one location; the effects of both leaky and short-circuited termination are also derived. All of these time constants are demonstrated as consequences of mathematical boundary value problems.

Cortico-cortical evoked potentials provide a unique window on functional brain networks because they contain sufficient information to infer dynamical properties of large-scale brain connectivity, such as preferred directionality and propagation latencies. Here, we developed a biologically informed modelling approach to estimate the neural physiological parameters of brain functional networks from the cortico-cortical evoked potentials recorded in a large multicentric database. Specifically, we considered each cortico-cortical evoked potential as the output of a transient stimulus entering the stimulated region, which directly propagated to the recording region. Both regions were modelled as coupled neural mass models, the parameters of which were estimated from the first cortico-cortical evoked potential component, occurring before 80 ms, using dynamic causal modelling and Bayesian model inversion. This methodology was applied to the data of 780 patients with epilepsy from the F-TRACT database, providing a total of 34 354 bipolar stimulations and 774 445 cortico-cortical evoked potentials. The cortical mapping of the local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic time constants and of the axonal conduction delays between cortical regions was obtained at the population level using anatomy-based averaging procedures, based on the Lausanne2008 and the HCP-MMP1 parcellation schemes, containing 130 and 360 parcels, respectively. To rule out brain maturation effects, a separate analysis was performed for older (>15 years) and younger patients (<15 years). In the group of older subjects, we found that the cortico-cortical axonal conduction delays between parcels were globally short (median = 10.2 ms) and only 16\% were larger than 20 ms. This was associated to a median velocity of 3.9 m/s. Although a general lengthening of these delays with the distance between the stimulating and recording contacts was observed across the cortex, some regions were less affected by this rule, such as the insula for which almost all efferent and afferent connections were faster than 10 ms. Synaptic time constants were found to be shorter in the sensorimotor, medial occipital and latero-temporal regions, than in other cortical areas. Finally, we found that axonal conduction delays were significantly larger in the group of subjects younger than 15 years, which corroborates that brain maturation increases the speed of brain dynamics. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a local estimation of axonal conduction delays and synaptic time constants across the whole human cortex in vivo, based on intracerebral electrophysiological recordings. Lemaréchal et al. model cortico-cortical evoked potentials to estimate axonal conduction delays, axonal velocity and synaptic time constants across the entire human cortex in vivo. By applying the methods to data from a large cohort of patients with epilepsy, they generate an atlas of dynamic cortical parameters.}},

Similarities in neocortical circuit organization across areas and species suggest a common strategy to process diverse types of information, including sensation from diverse modalities, motor control and higher cognitive processes. Cortical neurons belong to a small number of main classes. The properties of these classes, including their local and long-range connectivity, developmental history, gene expression, intrinsic physiology and in vivo activity patterns, are remarkably similar across areas. Each class contains subclasses; for a rapidly growing number of these, conserved patterns of input and output connections are also becoming evident. The ensemble of circuit connections constitutes a basic circuit pattern that appears to be repeated across neocortical areas, with area- and species-specific modifications. Such 'serially homologous' organization may adapt individual neocortical regions to the type of information each must process.}},

Once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. The runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing STDP rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. Here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. Induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. We suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic (STDP) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. We find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of STDP and input parameters. Synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. Our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity--Hebbian and heterosynaptic--may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories.}},

However, how neurons allocate resources to implement synaptic strength changes across space and time amongst neighbouring synapses remains unclear.

For example, the balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents has been identified as a central component of cortical computations. However, it remains unclear how the required synaptic connectivity can emerge in developing circuits where synapses between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are simultaneously plastic. Using theory and modeling, we propose that a wide range of cortical response properties can arise from a single plasticity paradigm that acts simultaneously at all excitatory and inhibitory connections—Hebbian learning that is stabilized by the synapse-type-specific competition for a limited supply of synaptic resources. In plastic recurrent circuits, this competition enables the formation and decorrelation of inhibition-balanced receptive fields. Networks develop an assembly structure with stronger synaptic connections between similarly tuned excitatory and inhibitory neurons and exhibit response normalization and orientation-specific center-surround suppression, reflecting the stimulus statistics during training. These results demonstrate how neurons can self-organize into functional networks and suggest an essential role for synapse-type-specific competitive learning in the development of cortical circuits.}},

Diverse types of inhibitory neurons serve vital functions in cortical networks, such as balancing excitation and taming excessive activity, organizing neuronal activity in spatial and temporal patterns, and shaping response selectivity. Serving these, and a multitude of other functions effectively requires fine-tuning of inhibition, mediated by synaptic plasticity. Plasticity of inhibitory systems can be mediated by changes at inhibitory synapses and/or by changes at excitatory synapses at inhibitory neurons. In this review, we consider that latter locus: plasticity at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons. Despite the fact that plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission to interneurons has been studied in much less detail than in pyramids and other excitatory cells, an abundance of forms and mechanisms of plasticity have been observed in interneurons. Specific requirements and rules for induction, while exhibiting a broad diversity, could correlate with distinct sources of excitatory inputs and distinct types of inhibitory neurons. One common requirement for the induction of plasticity is the rise of intracellular calcium, which could be mediated by a variety of ligand-gated, voltage-dependent, and intrinsic mechanisms. The majority of the investigated forms of plasticity can be classified as Hebbian-type associative plasticity. Hebbian-type learning rules mediate adaptive changes of synaptic transmission. However, these rules also introduce intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making plastic synapses and learning networks prone to runaway dynamics. Because real inhibitory neurons do not express runaway dynamics, additional plasticity mechanisms that counteract imbalances introduced by Hebbian-type rules must exist. We argue that weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity has a number of characteristics that make it an ideal candidate mechanism to achieve homeostatic regulation of synaptic weight changes at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons.}},

The induction of stable LTP was sensitive to stimulation variables on the day of HFS and was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein. The maintenance of stable LTP was also experience-dependent, because it was reversed when animals were exposed repeatedly to an enriched environment beginning 14 d post-HFS. However, stable LTP eventually consolidated over time and became resistant to reversal, because exposure to enriched environments 90 d post-HFS failed to influence stable LTP maintenance. Thus, LTP can be shown to meet one of the principal criteria for a very long-term memory storage mechanism.

While the nondecaying nature of LTP is thought to depend on protein synthesis and contribute to memory maintenance, little is known about the mechanisms and roles of decaying LTP. Here, we demonstrated that inhibiting endocytosis of postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) prevents LTP decay, thereby converting it into nondecaying LTP. Conversely, restoration of AMPAR endocytosis by inhibiting protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) converted nondecaying LTP into decaying LTP. Similarly, inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis prolonged memory retention in normal animals and reduced memory loss in a murine model of Alzheimer’s disease. These results strongly suggest that an active process that involves AMPAR endocytosis mediates the decay of LTP and that inhibition of this process can prolong the longevity of LTP as well as memory under both physiological and pathological conditions.}},

In particular, a soft-bound, weight-dependent learning rule has a very short retention time as compared with a learning rule that is independent of the synaptic weights. Next, we explore how the retention time is reflected in receptive field stability in networks. As in the single neuron case, the weight-dependent learning rule yields less stable receptive fields than a weight-independent rule. However, receptive fields stabilize in the presence of sufficient lateral inhibition, demonstrating that plasticity in networks can be regulated by inhibition and suggesting a novel role for inhibition in neural circuits.}},

Exploiting the classical analogy between the perceptron and the cerebellar Purkinje cell, we fitted the optimal weight distribution to that measured for granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses.

Here, using conditional depletion/deletion of GluN2B in D1-expressing accumbal medium spiny neurons, we examined the synaptic and behavioral actions that silent synapses incur after repeated exposure to cocaine. GluN2B ablation reduces the proportion of silent synapses, but some of them can persist by substitution with GluN2C, which drives the aberrantly facilitated synaptic incorporation of calcium-impermeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). The resulting precocious maturation of silent synapses impairs addiction memory but increases locomotor activity, both of which can be normalized by the blockade of calcium-impermeable AMPAR trafficking. Collectively, GluN2B supports the competence of cocaine-induced silent synapses to specify the subunit composition of AMPARs and thereby the expression of addiction memory and related behaviors.}},

LTP was induced by repeated, synchronous pairing of low-frequency presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. Three differences were observed. First, LTP of multi-unitary EPSPs displayed two phases: transient (<5 min) and sustained. Potentiation of unitary EPSPs displayed both phases in 42\% of experiments; the remainder showed sustained potentiation only. Unitary EPSPs displaying transient-sustained and only sustained potentiation could be recorded from single postsynaptic cells, indicating that excitatory synapses on a given cell are heterogeneous with respect to short-term plasticity. Second, whereas LTP of multi-unitary EPSPs never resulted in greater than twofold increases in amplitude (mean potentiation of 175\% of control), maximal LTP of unitary EPSPs was as great as 13-fold (mean potentiation of 250\%). Third, LTP could not be induced in 24\% of unitary EPSPs. We provide here the first evidence for the coexistence of potentiatable and nonpotentiatable synapses on individual postsynaptic neurons. Thirty-seven percent of connections not displaying LTP exhibited long-term depression (LTD), suggesting that the connections were already maximally potentiated. In the remaining 63\% of these pairs, neither LTP nor LTD could be induced, despite the existence of a pharmacologically identified, NMDA receptor-mediated EPSP component. In conclusion, there is considerable heterogeneity in the amplitude and time course of LTP expression at different synaptic connections. A substantial proportion of apparently nonplastic synapses probably accounts for the weaker potentiation displayed by compound EPSPs.}},

Confronted with the plethora of theoretical models for STDP available, we reexamine the experimental data. On this basis, we propose a novel STDP update rule, with a multiplicative dependence on the synaptic weight for depression, and a power law dependence for potentiation. We show that this rule, when implemented in large, balanced networks of realistic connectivity and sparseness, is compatible with the asynchronous irregular activity regime. The resultant equilibrium weight distribution is unimodal with fluctuating individual weight trajectories and does not exhibit development of structure. We investigate the robustness of our results with respect to the relative strength of depression.

After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.}},

abstract = {{Long-term potentiation of synapse strength requires enlargement of dendritic spines on cerebral pyramidal neurons. Long-term depression is linked to spine shrinkage. Indeed, spines are dynamic structures: they form, change their shapes and volumes, or can disappear in the space of hours. Do all such changes result from synaptic activity, or do some changes result from intrinsic processes? How do enlargement and shrinkage of spines relate to elimination and generation of spines, and how do these processes contribute to the stationary distribution of spine volumes? To answer these questions, we recorded the volumes of many individual spines daily for several days using two-photon imaging of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus between postnatal days 17 and 23. With normal synaptic transmission, spines often changed volume or were created or eliminated, thereby showing activity-dependent plasticity. However, we found that spines changed volume even after we blocked synaptic activity, reflecting a native instability of these small structures over the long term. Such “intrinsic fluctuations” showed unique dependence on spine volume. A mathematical model constructed from these data and the theory of random fluctuations explains population behaviors of spines, such as rates of elimination and generation, stationary distribution of volumes, and the long-term persistence of large spines. Our study finds that generation and elimination of spines are more prevalent than previously believed, and spine volume shows significant correlation with its age and life expectancy. The population dynamics of spines also predict key psychological features of memory.}},

abstract = {{How does the brain orchestrate perceptions, thoughts and actions from the spiking activity of its neurons? Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron–electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.}},
